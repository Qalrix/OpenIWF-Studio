# OpenIWF-Studio
A free, open-source editor for various IDO smartwatches such as the IDW20, ID207, GTX19, DR06, etc.

# How is it made?
This application is made with the Qt5 C++ Framework.

# Is it open-source?
Yes it is. You can re-use the codes or adapt them anytime.

# When will it be uploaded?
Around March or April (Or even May) because it's going to be a big project.

# Pre-Cautions
This tool does not support cloud dial versions 1 and 2. If you accidentally load v3 on your device, then you'll need to contact idoosmart at https://www.idoosmart.com/contact.html to repair your device.
Plus, sideloading cloud dials may expire your smartwatch's warranty and cannot be repaired.

# IMPORTANT INFO
I'm not associated with idoosmart (Shenzhen DO Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd.) or other Chinese companies.
You'll need a rooted android phone or an iPhone with developer mode turned on to replace the dials.
